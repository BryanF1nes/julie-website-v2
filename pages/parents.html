				<h1>Parents!</h1>
				<p>Hey there parents! You’re probably wondering who I think I am, what exactly are my
					Christian beliefs, and what makes me qualified to write children’s books. That’s
					cool, I
					mean, if I was in your shoes I’d be digging into me as well. So, here’s the real
					deal
					about me. I was raised in a Christina home. I attended First Assembly of God
					church in
					Erie, PA, and graduated from Valley Forge Christian College (now University of
					Valley
					Forge) with a Bachelor of Science in Bible. I’ve worked in Kids Ministry at
					Bible
					believing churches for over 25 years (Wow, didn’t realize it has been that
					long!). I was
					the fun, creative Bible story teller. I also served as a Kids Director. I love
					Jesus, I
					love
					kids, I love fun, and I love bringing them all together. My desire is for
					families to
					grow in
					the grace and knowledge of Jesus Christ as they raise tiny disciples. The battle
					for our
					kids starts at home. Hopefully my books can open a door of communication with
					your
					kids about Jesus. Raising tiny disciples is a tough job. Let’s do it together!
				</p>

				<h1>Raising Tiny Disciples</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>Put them in the kid’s service at your church. Start them young! It’s never
						too soon
						to experience God’s love. Even babies can hear songs about Jesus and His
						love.</li>
					<li>Get together with other families who have kids and share the same values you
						have. Our kids were blessed to be surrounded by friends who were a
						little older
						than them. They had great examples of what it looked like for someone
						close to
						their age to follow Jesus, and our friends were an example of what Godly
						parenting looked like.</li>
					<li>Read parenting books written by Christian authors or authors who seem to
						have
						the same values as you. Some of my favorites are:
						<ul id="last-ul">
							<li>Kevin Leman, Making Children Mind Without Losing Yours</li>
							<li>Elisa Morgan, Real Moms</li>
							<li>Lisa Bevere, Girls With Swords</li>
							<li>Patricia H. Rushford, What Kids Need Most in a Mom</li>
							<li>Gary Chapman, The 5 Love Languages</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Pray. Pray. Then, pray some more. I have included an article I have had
						since
						before I even had my own children. 31 Biblica Virtues to Pray for Your
						Kids was
						my guide to praying Scripture over my kids. Now, I use this to pray over
						my
						granddaughter and future grandchildren.</li>
				</ul>
